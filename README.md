## App Workflow

1. **Start Screen:** The app opens with a "Letâ€™s Start" screen, introducing the user to Stitchtly-BarScanner.
2. **Login:** If the user is not logged in, they are directed to the login page. Successful login ensures they remain authenticated, even after restarting the app.
3. **Bluetooth Connection:** A dialog appears for the user to connect to an ESP32 device. Once connected, the connection remains active across sessions.
4. **Bar Code Scanning:** Upon successful connection, the user is redirected to the Bar code scanner to scan and send data to the device.
5. **Persistent Sessions:** Both the login and Bluetooth connection states are preserved, ensuring a seamless user experience every time.

## Persistence and State Management

We use AsyncStorage to persist user authentication and Bluetooth connection status, ensuring a continuous and uninterrupted workflow.

- **Authentication**: Users remain logged in, eliminating the need to re-enter credentials on app restart.
- **Bluetooth Connection**: If a device is connected, the app remembers the connection and avoids showing the connection dialog unnecessarily.

## Code Structure

- **/app:** Contains all the primary screens, including the start, layout, login, device connection, and Bar scanner.
- **/components:** Modular and reusable components such as DeviceConnectionModal.
- **/hooks:** Custom hooks for managing Bluetooth connections using react-native-ble-plx.
- **/context:** State management using React Context API.
